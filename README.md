sample project with conda environment
==============================

Create new environment: conda env create -f environment.yml -n ml-env
Update environment: conda env update -f environment.yml -n ml-env


## Overview

This project uses:

* `conda` for managing the development environment.
* `kedro` for structuring the source code and organising data pipelines.


## A Note About Git Tracking

The `.gitignore` file of this repository has been configured to avoid tracking the following files:

* Any files whose names contain the word `credential`.
* All files in the `conf/local` folder.
* All files in the `data` folder (you can use this folder to stored temporary files for your experiments).


### 1. Managing the Development Environment

To initialise the development environment, run the following `conda` command at the project's root directory:

```
conda env create --prefix ./.conda-env --file environment.yml
conda activate ./.conda-env
```

To update the environment after changing the 'environment.yml' file, use the following command:

```
conda env update --prefix ./.conda-env --file environment.yml --prune
```

Or simply, rebuild the environment from scratch:

```
conda env create --prefix ./.conda-env --file environment.yml --force
```

### 3. Streamlit
pip install streamlit
streamlit hello

Fixing error in Streamlit:
- https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/toml-docoder-error/1400/39
- In windows, go to the C:/Windows/Users/%profile name%/.streamlit, delete the toml files and restart streamlit run app.py
- For those who fail the deployment on Heroku. You might found several tutorials suggesting the setup.sh, but please have a look when you copy-paste the code. I deploy the website without deleting the config.toml file. 

1. Create file multiplage.py
2. Create folder page
3. Create analysis app files in page folder
4. Import analysis app files in file app.py

### 4. Config
1. file config.yml
